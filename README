In Python code blocks are delimited by indentation which some people consider a negative aspect of the language . In this project I have tried to come up with a different version of the language which does not require indentation to separate one code block from another. Rather it uses keywords like end, endif to demarcate end of a code construct. The features that I have implemented are Function Calls, Parameter List, Decision Structures, Mathematical Operations, Logical Operations and Print Statements.

Instructions for Executing the Code:-

As a pre-requisite you will need to install Flex And Bison.
Once you are done with that run "make" command to compile the code.
And then do "make test" to execute the python test-case files.
